# Analysis
## `bilayer_analysis_functions.py`
Analysis functions for basic bilayer structural properties (APL, APT, tilt, offsets,
S2, interdigitation, density profiles, height)
## `grid_analysis.py`
Functions to grid-up and analyzel leaflets, used with permeability calculations
## `interfacial_roughness.py`
Functions to analyze the roughness of the bilayer/water interface
## `group_templates.py`
Contains information about head groups and tail groups for different lipid molecules,
depending on the forcefield used
## `visualize_curvature.py`
Use matplotlib to animate the Z-coordinates of lipids over the course of a simulation
## `bootstrap_perm_pickle.py`
Utilize a bootstrapping methodology for Z-constrained simulations to resample force timeseries and compute diffusion, free energy, and permeability
## `naive_perm_pickle.py
Utilize a naive statistical sampling for Z-constrained simulations to resample force timeseries and compute diffusion, free energy, and permeability
