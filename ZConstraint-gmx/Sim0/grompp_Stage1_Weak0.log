GROMACS:      gmx grompp, VERSION 5.1
Executable:   /raid6/software/gromacs_5.1.0//bin/gmx
Data prefix:  /raid6/software/gromacs_5.1.0/
Command line:
  gmx grompp -f Stage1_Weak0.mdp -c RedonepureDSPC.gro -p RedonepureDSPC.top -n FullIndex.ndx -o Stage1_Weak0.tpr -maxwarn 2

Replacing old mdp entry 'nstxtcout' by 'nstxout-compressed'

Back Off! I just backed up mdout.mdp to ./#mdout.mdp.1#

NOTE 1 [file Stage1_Weak0.mdp]:
  nstcomm < nstcalcenergy defeats the purpose of nstcalcenergy, setting
  nstcomm to nstcalcenergy


NOTE 2 [file Stage1_Weak0.mdp]:
  leapfrog does not yet support Nose-Hoover chains, nhchainlength reset to 1

WARNING 1 [file Stage1_Weak0.mdp]:
  You are using an absolute reference for pulling, but the rest of the
  system does not have an absolute reference. This will lead to artifacts.
